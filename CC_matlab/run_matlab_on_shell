# The MATLAB R2020A executable is found by going to the normal Matlab IDE and typing
 matlabroot
# This will produce
 '/Applications/MATLAB_R2020a.app'
# The command line command 'matlab' is aliased to call this executable with the -batch option, so
 /Users/karthik/Applications/MATLAB_R2020a.app/bin/matlab -batch "statements"
# "statements" is any list of Matlab code. So, to call a function with arguments, we have 
matlab "function(arg1,arg2,...)" 
# where "function" refers to function.m. The .m extension is always left out
